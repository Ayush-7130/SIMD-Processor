# SISD Processor with Custom 32-bit DRAM

## Project Overview

This project involves the design and implementation of a Single Instruction Single Data (SISD) processor integrated with a custom 32-bit Dynamic Random-Access Memory (DRAM) system. The goal is to achieve optimized sequential instruction execution, faster memory access, and reduced latency by tailoring the DRAM array to the processor's specific needs.

## Key Features

- SISD Processor: Simulated version of a Single Instruction Single Data Processor.
- Custom 32-bit DRAM: A tailored DRAM system designed to enhance memory performance.
- Optimized Sequential Execution: The processor is designed to execute instructions sequentially for efficient processing.
- Improved Memory Access: Custom DRAM integration ensures faster memory access and reduced latency.
- Cross-Functional Collaboration: The project was accomplished through collaboration with a cross-functional team.
- Rigorous Testing: Extensive testing was conducted to ensure the reliability and performance of the processor and DRAM.
- Seamless Integration: The SISD processor and custom DRAM were seamlessly integrated to achieve project goals.

## Technology Stack

- Theoretical Knowledge of Computer Organization and Architecture: Concepts related to processor design, memory systems, and computer organization.
- `Logisim`: A digital circuit design and simulation tool used for the development and simulation of the SISD processor and custom DRAM.

## Project Structure

The project is organized as follows:

- `SISD.circ`: Logisim circuit file for the SISD processor and another circuit file for the custom 32-bit DRAM.
- `Documentation/`: Contains project documentation, design specifications, and notes.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open the `SISD.circ` file in Logisim for simulation and further exploration.
3. Refer to the project documentation for detailed information on the design, architecture, and testing procedures.
